Notes:
- You may not be able to see the ship in flight Mode if the camera is zoomed out too far. If you lose sight of the ship just use scroll to zoom in.
- In Flight mode will experience some lag as it first renders the gas giants with their many moons, however by the time you fly to them performance should be nominal.
- In the system all planets begin aligned with each other, this is for ease of navigation, as you explore the system, planets will slowly disperse as their orbital period depends on their distance from the sun.
- The moons of the gas giants also appear close together in the beginning, but much like the planets they will disperse as you explore the system.
- In Flight mode you will not be able to see the lasers if you adjust the camera to be directly behind the ship. The default for the camera is slightly raised to prevent this.
